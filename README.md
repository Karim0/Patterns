# Patterns

In this project realized design patterns. 
There are <br>
<ul>
  <li>birder</li>
  <li>factory</li>
  <li>prototype</li>
  <li>singelton</li>
  <li>adapter</li>
  <li>bridge</li>
  <li>composite</li>
  <li>decorators</li>
  <li>facade</li>
</ul>


<p>You can work quite successfully without knowing a single pattern. But knowing the patterns, you get another tool in your personal professional set.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you spend less time writing code.</li>
<li>Secondly, using design patterns, you do less calculations when writing code, since all the hidden problems in them have long been found.</li>
<li>In the end, patterns make communication with other programmers easier, because instead of explaining how your code works, you just say the name of the pattern.</li>
</ul>
